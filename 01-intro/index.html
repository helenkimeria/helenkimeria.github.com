	   <h1>Helen Kimeria</h1>
       <br>
	   <p>Hello. My name is Helen. I am a graphic design professional. I have BFA in Graphic Design & Visual Communication with a minor in creative writing and poetry. I currently work in higher education at Emmanuel College in the marketing communications area. I oversee the Colleges visual communications efforts and am responsible for managing their visual brand and graphic identity system. I am also a print buyer and manager.</p>
	
		<p>Why am I taking this class? My graphic design experience up to this point has been mainly in print design. I've done a little web design, but not enough to feel completely comfortable taking on larger projects. I am very interested in learning the ins and outs of web design and development. I'd like to learn about HTML5, CSS3, the JQuery Library, and designing for the mobile web.</p>
        
        <p>A little fun fact about me: I am an identical twin. And my mother is also a twin. AND my father is a twin too. Yes, twins run in my family.</p>
